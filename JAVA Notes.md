Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in 1995 (now owned by Oracle). 
Itâ€™s known for its platform independence, meaning code written in Java can run anywhere with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java Environment::
*JDK :(Java Development Kit): Tools for developing Java applications.
*JRE :(Java Runtime Environment): Environment to run Java programs.
*JVM :(Java Virtual Machine): Executes Java bytecode on any platform.

Basic Syntax::Java uses a class-based structure.

Every program starts with a main() method:
*java syntax
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}

Data Types:: Java is strongly typed, meaning every variable must have a declared type.
Examples:int, float, double, char, boolean, String.

Variables:: A variable is a name given to a memory location.
Example:java
int age = 25;

Operators:: Used for arithmetic, logical, relational operations.
Examples: +, -, *, /, ==, !=, &&, ||

Control Statements:: Conditional: if, else, switch
Loops: for, while, do-while
